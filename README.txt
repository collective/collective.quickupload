==================
Plone Quick Upload
==================

TRUEGALLERY-COMPATIBILITY
=========================

Created by Huub Bouma (huub_bouma)
Although I don't know anything about truegallery or mootools, it seems
like there is a namespace clash for 'Browser'
This branch just renames the Browser namespace to QuickUploadBrowser
which will fix the Browser undefines issue

Description
===========
This product offers a multiple files upload tool for Plone, with multi selection,
drag and drop, and progress bar. A pure javacript tool is used on client side,
with html5 file fields and ajax upload for modern browsers, and a graceful fallback for other browsers.
You can also choose to replace the javascript with jquery.uploadify, a flashupload based script
which could be interesting in rare situations (Plone site for MSIE client's browsers only, without
http authentication in front, and no https).

To install it in your buildout, just add 'collective.quickupload' to your egg list, then

  >> bin/buildout

To install it in Plone, use the Addons control panel, select "Plone Quick Upload" Product
and install it.

To see it in action, just assign the Quick Upload portlet somewhere in your site
and test it.

Details
=======

This package contains :

collective.quickupload.browser
------------------------------

 -  A simple ajax view that can be called by any plone template.

 -  This view is using a javascript multiple upload tool based on fileuploader.js (a fork with many ameliorations of
    http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) OR jquery.uploadify.js (based on flashupload, see also collective.uploadify plone product
    from which some parts of code have been taken)

    - By default the javascript only method is used : the fileuploader.js is a pure ajax file uploader which uses
      html5 multiple file fields and ajax upload post method. It's not a jquery plugin. For modern browsers
      like FireFox 3.6+, Chrome, or Safari 4+, it offers drag and drop, multi-selection, and progress bar during upload.
      For other browsers (IE7, IE8, ...),  the script offers a graceful hidden iframe upload fall back.

    - Flashupload (jquery.uploadify) is more user friendly under MSIE, but has some "big" problems :

      - cannot be used behind any kind of http authentication (basic authentication, windowsNT authentication, ...)

      - cannot be used through https

      - not open source

    - the webmaster has the choice between these 2 solutions (see control panel below).

    - the upload form can be viewed only with permission CMF.AddPortalContent on context

    - the upload form can be viewed  only for objects providing IQuickUploadCapable, by default ATFolder, ATBTreeFolder and Plone Site
      are implementing IQuickUploadCapable

    - the quickupload form allows to fill title and description for each uploaded file (see control panel below)

    - the quickupload view log and returns errors to the form (unauthorized, id always exist, type not allowed, etc ... )

    - the view can use some attributes set in session or request::

      -  force mediatype (could be None, image, video, audio, or something like this '*.pdf;*.doc;')

         if a mediatype is set in request :

          -  with fileuploader.js an error is raised in the form when a file content-type selected is not correct.

          -  with Flashupload, only choosed content types are shown in selection  window,
             with a specific message "select images", "select video files" (...).

      -  force portal_type

         if portal_type is not set in request, content_type_registry is used to find the good portal_type, otherwise the "File" portal_type will be used.

 - a basic Plone Control panel with some options::

    - use flashupload (yes/no), default = no

    - fill file's titles in form (yes/no), default = yes

    - fill file's descriptions in form (yes/no), default = no

    - automatic upload on select (yes/no), default=no

    - max size limit for each file in KB (default= 0 = no limit)

    - simultaneous uploads limit (default=2, 0 = no limit)


collective.quickupload.portlet
------------------------------

 - a portlet calling the quickupload ajax view (it's also an example on how to use the quick_upload view)

 - the portlet is not assigned (can be done TTW or in another package)


collective.quickupload.profiles
-------------------------------

 - control panel GS profile

 - the javascript and css registry GS profile

 - portlet GS profile


quickupload.tests
-----------------

 - doctests for control panel, portlet, and quick_upload view


Compliance
==========

- Plone 4.x

Plone 3.3.x support stopped with 1.0.3.


About fileuploader.js fork
==========================

These ameliorations have been done :

- queue uploads

- graphic progress bar

- simultaneous upload limit

- can send all files in a second time, after multiple selections, and after different actions on form.

- can add new fields using a new method (onAfterSelect), associated to each file

- debugMode and debugConsole

- css improvements

How To
======

- How to add the quickupload view in my own template or viewlet ?

  Just look the quickupload portlet code, it's really easy.

  You can also take a look at collective.plonefinder product
  http://plone.org/products/collective.plonefinder
  which requires collective.quickupload.

- How to set by code types where upload is allowed ?

  You include minimal.zcml only, adding to your product configure.zcml::

      <exclude package="collective.quickupload" file="configure.zcml" />
      <include package="collective.quickupload" file="minimal.zcml" />

  And you implement IUploadCapable on types you want::

      <class class=".content.EPRIVR_Documents.EPRIVR_Domain">
        <implements interface="collective.quickupload.browser.interfaces.IQuickUploadCapable" />
      </class>

- How to exclude upload on some types ?

  If a type implements IQuickUploadNotCapable, portlet will never be shown on it.
  Add to your zcml::

      <class class=".content.MyContent">
        <implements interface="collective.quickupload.browser.interfaces.IQuickUploadNotCapable" />
      </class>

TODO
====

- javascript client tests

- unit tests for upload methods

- fileuploader.js refactorisation using jquery
