Changelog

1.11.0 (2017-03-13)
-------------------

- Allow custom error messages. [jone]

- Fix umlauts in error messages. [jone]

1.10.0 (2016-12-07)
-------------------

- Fix inconsistent 'object_unique_id' default configuration value.
  Also use 'False' as default value for a fresh installation to be consistent with
  the upgrade step and the form default value.
  [deiferni]


1.9.0 (2016-11-10)
------------------

- Always abort the transaction when the file-upload fails with an error.
  This prevents constructing partial files when a file-factory or
  a file-updater fails after creating the content object.
  [deiferni]

- Updated Dutch translations.
  [maurits]

- Fixed a Bug with jQuery 1.9+ in quickuploadportlet.py which prevents portlet
  to be rendered. Added a try catch clause. [loechel]

------------------

- Add controlpanel option "Use id as title" to not prettify
  the title but use the id ('my-file.jpg' instead of 'my file')

1.8.0 (2015-09-30)
------------------

- Add property 'Choose unique file id'.

  can upload files without overriding them and without an
  error if the file already exists

1.7.0 (2015-07-28)
------------------

- Move handling of ConflictErrors to client side.
